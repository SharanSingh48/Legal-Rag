Respondent\nJ U D G M E N T\nDipak Misra, J.\nLong back, an eminent thinker and author, Sophocles, had to say: \n“Law can never be enforced unless fear supports them.”\nThough the aforesaid statement was made centuries back, it has its pertinence, in a way, with \nthe enormous vigour, in today’s society. It is the duty of every rightthinking citizen to show \nveneration to law so that an orderly, civilized and peaceful society emerges. It has to be borne \nin mind that law is averse to any kind of chaos. It is totally intolerant of anarchy. If any one \ndefies law, he has to face the wrath of law, depending on the concept of proportionality that \nthe law recognizes. It can never be forgotten that the purpose of criminal law legislated by \nthe competent legislatures, subject to judicial scrutiny within constitutionally established \nparameters, is to protect the collective interest and save every individual that forms a \nconstituent of the collective from unwarranted hazards. It is sometimes said in an egocentric \nand uncivilised manner that law cannot bind the individual actions which are perceived as \nflaws by the large body of people, but, the truth is and has to be that when the law withstands \nthe test of the constitutional scrutiny in a democracy, the individual notions are to be ignored. \nAt times certain crimes assume more accent and gravity depending on the nature and impact of \nthe crime on the society. No court should ignore the same being swayed by passion of mercy. It is \nthe obligation of the court to constantly remind itself that the right of the victim, and be it said, \non certain occasions the person aggrieved as well as the society at large can be victims, never \nbe marginalised. In this context one may recapitulate the saying of Justice Benjamin N. Cardizo \n“Justice, though due to the accused, is due to the accuser too”. And, therefore, the requisite \nnorm has to be the established principles laid down in precedents. It is neither to be guided by \na sense of sentimentality nor to be governed by prejudices.

{"text": "=== 18 Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority “18. Just punishment is the collective cry of the society. While the collective cry has to be kept uppermost in the mind, simultaneously the principle of proportionality between the crime and punishment cannot be totally brushed aside. The principle of just punishment is the bedrock of sentencing in respect of a criminal offence. A punishment should not be disproportionately excessive. The concept of proportionality allows a significant discretion to the Judge but the same has to be guided by certain principles. In certain cases, the nature of culpability, the antecedents of the accused, the factum of age, the potentiality of the convict to become a criminal in future, capability of his reformation and to lead an acceptable life in the prevalent milieu, the effect — propensity to become a social threat or nuisance, and sometimes lapse of time in the commission of the crime and his conduct in the interregnum bearing in mind the nature of the offence, the relationship between the parties and attractability of the doctrine of bringing the convict to the value-based social mainstream may be the guiding factors. Needless to emphasise, these are certain illustrative aspects put forth in a condensed manner. We may hasten to add that there can neither be a straitjacket formula nor a solvable theory in mathematical exactitude. It would be dependent on the facts of the case and rationalised judicial discretion. Neither the personal perception of a Judge nor selfadhered moralistic vision nor hypothetical apprehensions should be allowed to have any play. For every offence, a drastic measure cannot be thought of. Similarly, an offender cannot be allowed to be treated with leniency solely on the ground of discretion vested in a court. The real requisite is to weigh the circumstances in which the crime has been committed and other concomitant factors which we have indicated hereinbefore and also have been stated in a number of pronouncements by this Court. On such touchstone, the sentences are to be imposed. The discretion should not be in the realm of fancy. It should be embedded in the conceptual essence of just punishment.” 16. In Shyam Narain v. State (NCT of Delhi)17 though in a different context while dealing with the issue of sentencing it has been stated that primarily it is to be borne in mind that sentencing for any offence has a social goal. Sentence is to be imposed regard being had to the nature of the offence and the manner in which the offence has been committed. The fundamental purpose of imposition of sentence is based on the principle that the accused must realise that the crime committed by him has not only created a dent in his life but also a concavity in the social fabric. The purpose of just punishment is designed so that the individuals in the society which ultimately constitute the collective do not suffer time and again for such crimes. It serves as a deterrent. True it is, on certain occasions, opportunities may be granted to the convict for reforming himself but it is equally true that the principle of proportionality between an offence committed and the penalty imposed are to be kept in view.

A man with the means has, in \npossibility, graduated himself to harbour the idea that he can escape from the substantive \nsentence by payment of compensation. Neither the law nor the court that implements \nthe law should ever get oblivious of the fact that in such accidents precious lives are lost \nor the victims who survive are crippled for life which, in a way, worse then death.

In our \nopinion, it is a fit case where we are constrained to say that the High Court has been swayed \naway by the passion of  mercy in applying the principle that payment of compensation is \na factor for reduction of sentence to 24 days. It is absolutely in the realm of misplaced \nsympathy. It is, in a way mockery of justice.

If the parents of the boy or girl do not approve of such intercaste or inter-religious marriage the maximum they can do is that they can cut-off social relations with the son or the daughter, but they cannot give threats or commit or instigate acts of violence and cannot harass the person who undergoes such inter-caste or inter-religious marriage. We, therefore, direct that the administration/police authorities throughout the country will see to it that if any boy or girl who is a major undergoes inter-caste or inter-religious marriage with a woman or man who is a major, the couple is not harassed by anyone nor subjected to threats or acts of violence, and anyone who gives such threats or harasses or commits acts of violence either himself or at his instigation, is taken to task by instituting criminal proceedings by the police against such persons and further stern action is taken against such persons as provided by law. 18. We sometimes hear of “honour” killings of such persons who undergo inter-caste or inter-religious marriage of their own free will. There is nothing honourable in such killings, and in fact they are nothing but barbaric and shameful acts of murder committed by brutal, feudal-minded persons who deserve harsh punishment. Only in this way can we stamp out such acts of barbarism.” 11) In Arumugam Servai vs. State of Tamilnadu, (2011) 6 SCC 405, this Court, in paras 12 and 13, observed as under:- “12.

We are of the opinion that this is wholly illegal and has to be ruthlessly stamped out. As already stated in Lata Singh case, there is nothing honourable in honour killing or other atrocities and, in fact, it is nothing but barbaric and shameful murder. Other atrocities in respect of personal lives of people committed by brutal, feudal-minded persons deserve harsh punishment. Only in this way can we stamp out such acts of barbarism and feudal mentality. Moreover, these acts take the law into their own hands, and amount to kangaroo courts, which are wholly illegal. 13. Hence, we direct the administrative and police officials to take strong measures to prevent such atrocious acts.

The Act will apply only in Delhi and not outside Delhi. The provisions of the Act will apply to the shops and establishments located in Delhi and not to any establishment working outside Delhi. Thus, the office which the petitioner had in Iraq by itself cannot be termed as an establishment to be covered under the Act. Also it has been held by the Delhi High Court that the mere fact that the business of the petitioner is being carried on from that office so the petitioner’s officer in Delhi could not be treated as an establishment to be covered under the Act; Bhandari Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. M.K. Seth, 1988 (15) DRJ 77 (SN).

The scope of the Act is a progressive piece of legislation and design to settle the disputes on a new pattern hitherto intention to judicial machinery set in the country. The object of all labour legislation is to ensure fair wages and to prevent disputes so that production might not be adversely affected. 2.

{"text": "—”Holiday” \nHolidays are off days granted by the employer to the employees either voluntarily or \ncompulsorily under the force of law. The Dictionary meaning of a ‘Holiday’ is ‘A day on which \nordinary occupations (of an individual or a community) are suspended; a day of festivity, \nrecreation or amusement’. (Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. V). The introduction of paid holidays \nfor workers, both in law, and in practice, is based on the one hand on the ‘employees’ right to \nleisure and to the opportunity of developing his personality and, on the other, on the necessity of \npreserving or restoring his health and strength in the interests of production and service to be \nrendered. Holidays with pay, if they are properly utilized, may provide a real and complete escape \nfrom the ideal means of relaxation and afford abundant opportunity of gaining material and social \nexperience under different conditions and workers generally undertake factory work because of \nnecessity. \nEmployees return to their jobs with fresh enthusiasm and renewed reserves of strength after \nspending their holidays under suitably restful conditions. This is confirmed by the conclusion \nreached in the many recent studies of the psychology or work, especially in the field of \nproductivity.

The use of the expression, “at the disposal of the employer” is not without any significance. It indicates that the person so employed must be available to work and to be under the control or supervision of the employer during the working hours and it seems to be immaterial whether the person so employed has worked during the entire working hours or not or whether the employer has taken any work from him. The only obligation appears to be that he must remain at the disposal of the employer throughout the working hours fixed under the Act, excluding of course the time allowed for rest and meals. Sub-section (16)—”Leave” The expressions ‘leave means leave of absence, that is to say, the permission obtained by an employee from his employer relieving him from the duty of attending the work with or without pay.

However, when \npayment is made on monthly scale of pay, the daily rate of wages for a worker can be obtained \nonly by dividing the amount of wages for 30 days by 26. This is done because the workman is \nentitled to four days as weekly rest during which period he does not work. The reason is that \nworkman actually gets monthly wages for the work done only for 26 days. Thus for a workman, it \nis the actual receipt for 26 days which is his monthly scale of pay, i.e., 30 days wages. Therefore, \na day’s wage should mean the result obtained by dividing the monthly wages by actual number of \nworking days, i.e., 26 days. This principle will, however, be applicable in case of such workers \nwho get monthly wages only for the actual number of working days. The formula for calculation of \nthe overtime wages for one hour is to divide the month’s wages by 26 into the number of normal \nworking hours and the result so obtained by them then multiplied by two to calculate one hour’s \novertime wages; P. Radhakrishnan Nair v. K.S.R.T.C., 1983 Lab. IC 276 (Ker. HC). Similarly, a \nday’s wage should mean the result obtained by dividing the monthly wages by actual number of \nworking days; K.S. Verma v. The Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, 1979 Lab \nIC 107: 1979 LLR 150. \nIn one case before the Supreme Court, the management had prescribed 39 hours and had \nagreed to pay overtime wages for any work taken in excess of such normal working hours and \nupto the maximum, i.e., 48 hours at 1½ times the ordinary rate of wages and beyond the \nmaximum, i.e., 48 hours and upto 54 hours at double the rate of ordinary wages and the question \nposed was where the employer prescribes working hours less than the maximum permissible in \nthe statute, does he incur the obligation to pay overtime wages at the rates prescribed in the \nTamil Nadu Shops & Establishments Act, 1947. The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by \nthe management and reversed the decision of the High Court directing payment of overtime \nwages by twice the ordinary rates of wages for any work beyond the prescribed 39 hours and \nupto 48 hours; Philips India Ltd. v. Labour Court, Madras, AIR 1985 SC 1034: 1985 (1) LLN 633: \n1985 (66) FJR 474. \nHowever, the Allahabad High Court has held that if the workers are required to work for \nadditional hours but if such additional hours will be less than 48 hours in a week, the employees \nwill be entitled to wages and not overtime; New Victoria Mills, Unit of National Textile Corporation, \nUttar Pradesh Ltd. v.
